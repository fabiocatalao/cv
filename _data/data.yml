    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I studied at University of Minho (Braga, Portugal) from 2008 to 2013 where I took my Informatics Engineering Bachelor and my Informatics Engineering Masters, the last one focused on Business Intelligence Systems and Machine Learning with strong Data Warehousing and Data Mining dimensions.
      After my studies, I worked at WeDo Technologies as Data Engineer (2013-2016), taking part in a team responsible for the implementation and maintenance of WeDo proprietary revenue assurance solution at Sonae, one of the biggest retail companies in Portugal.
      Later, I worked as a Backend Software Engineer at BySide (2016 and 2018). There I worked in web development, data handling, and enhancing the performance of various services.
      I'm currently working as a Data Engineer for the Credit Suisse Compliance department (since 2019) on a project responsible for sourcing data from a great diversity of sources into an analytical platform to provide the needed data to Data Scientists. I'm working as a Data Engineer sourcing data, collaborating on the development of an internal ETL solution as well as designing pipeline development and deployment processes. As a senior member of the team, I am a technical advisor for the rest of my team and our stakeholders.
